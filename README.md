# DAQ_Synchronization_Project
The codes included in here were primarily worked on by myself during my time working in the Anschutz Medical Campus's Optogenetic Neural Engineering Core. While I cannot claim entire ownership of these codes (in particular the Arduino barcode generator), I did make very significant contributions to all of them.
